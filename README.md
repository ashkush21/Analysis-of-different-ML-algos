# Cloth Type Classifier

This project classifies the type of cloth from the given image. The model is trained using the Fashion-MNIST data set.

The main features of the project are: 
1. It analyses different layer Neural-Networks for the models and choses the most optimal model.
2. After choosing the structure, model optimized by checking the accuracy for different learning rates (with exponential decay)
3. The we try to use different optimizers for the model and see how they perform. 
4. All the analysis is done by using line plots.
